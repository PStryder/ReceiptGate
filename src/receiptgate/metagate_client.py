"""ReceiptGate's binding to the shared MetaGate bootstrap client.

The client lives in the LegiVellum shared package so the gates do not each grow
their own copy. All this module contributes is the one genuinely
ReceiptGate-specific thing: which primitive types map to which settings.

Loading is by file path rather than `from legivellum.metagate_bootstrap import
...` on purpose. That statement executes legivellum/__init__.py, which pulls in
the control plane's dependency tree (ulid, sqlalchemy, fastapi) that a gate has
no reason to install. The bootstrap client itself needs only httpx, which every
gate already has, so it is loaded as a standalone module.

The load is best-effort: a gate must start whether or not a LegiVellum checkout
is beside it, consistent with bootstrap never being allowed to block startup.
